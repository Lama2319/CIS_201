<p>This is a short story about me. I am the middle daughter and I have three siblings. When I graduated from school, I did not know what I would specialize in any field. 
I was almost lost. However, I relied on supplication during this period, and this is something that helped me, and the support of my family helped me a lot. I am now a second-year student at Al-Yamamah University majoring in Network Security Engineering, and I feel that this is the place I belong to.</p>
